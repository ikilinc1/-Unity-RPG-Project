Hey there!

Thanks so much for downloading the Fantasy Tavern Music Pack! 
This is the first in a series of Medieval fantasy music packs I plan to release. 
Each track is in .wav format for lossless audio quality and I composed them such that 
they can be looped seamlessly. No trimming or editing required!

As this is my first game music pack, I'd love to know what you think of it! 
For any feedback, questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me using

Hope you enjoy the Fantasy Tavern Music Pack! 
May these tunes liven up your taverns, inns, or any other torch-lit fantasy setting. 

Cheers!
